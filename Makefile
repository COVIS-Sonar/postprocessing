## By default, every test will use a new temporary directory, so there will be
# a lot of time spent unpacking and reprocessing.  You can cirumvent this
# behavior by setting the COVIS_TEST_TEMP, which will be used as the tempdir
# location in every test -- note this will cause some tests to see
# existing data from previous tests and perhaps run differently
